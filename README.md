This repository will contain my personal portfolio as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web design 300 hour course. 
Hopefully I'll get to a good result and pass all the automated tests. 

It's expected to use plain CSS and html to make the site look good and appealing.

My strategy is to keep things neat and functional. As for Colors I will use an online tool to provide advise, since color ain't my thing at all. Hopefully this will be done in about 4 hoours.

Cheers.
